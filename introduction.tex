\chapter{Introduction}

In this thesis I propose an alternative proof for the de Moivre-Laplace theorem. This established theorem states that the standardized binomial distribution given by the probability mass function
\begin{align}
  \bb{\x} = \binom nk p^k q^{n-k}
\end{align}
with $\x[k] = \frac{k-np}{\sqrt{npq}}$ for $p\in (0,1)$, $q=1-p$, $k,n\in\N$, and $k\le n$ can be approximated by the standardized normal distribution, the density function being $\fphi{x} = \frac{1}{\sqrt {2\pi}} \fexp{-\frac{x^2}2}$.

In contrast to the standard proof using Stirlingâ€™s formula, my alternative proof, detailed in the following, approximates the slope between neighboring $\bb{\x}$. Derived from this I get an ordinary differential equation (ODE) the solution of which is the normal distribution. Hence, the new proof also represents an interesting application of the theory of ODEs (especially one-step methods) to probability theory.

In this thesis, I focus on two potential advantages my alternative proof might offer over the traditional method:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item I compare the error estimate of the standard proof with the error bounds provided by the new proof. As a result, we can see whether the new proof yields better approximations or better error estimations.

  \item The new proof may be easier to understand than the standard proof and thus may be a better choice for teaching.
\end{enumerate}
