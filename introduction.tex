\chapter{Introduction}

In this thesis I present a new proof for the theorem by de Moivre and Laplace. This theorem states that the standardized binomial distribution given by the probability mass function
\begin{align}
  \bb{\x} = \binom nk p^k q^{n-k}
\end{align}
with $\x[k] = \frac{k-np}{\sqrt{npq}}$ for $p\in (0,1)$, $q=1-p$, $k,n\in\N$, and $k\le n$ can be approximated by the standardized normal distribution whose density function is $\fphi{x} = \frac{1}{\sqrt {2\pi}} \fexp{-\frac{x^2}2}$.

The new proof approximates the slope between neighboring $\bb{\x}$ and derives from it an ordinary differential equation (ODE) whose solution is the normal distribution. Hence it will give an interesting application of the theory of ODEs (especially one-step methods) to probability theory.

There are two possible advantages of the new proof which we will investigate in this thesis:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item We will compare the error estimate of the standard proof using Stirling's formula with the error bounds provided by the new proof. Thus we can see whether the new proof yield better approximations or better error estimations.

  \item The new proof may be easier to understand than the standard proof and thus may be used in a course or a textbook.
\end{enumerate}
