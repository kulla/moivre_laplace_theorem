\chapter*{Acknowledgment}

I would like to thank my supervisor \href{http://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/personen/professoren/pickl/index.html}{Prof. Dr. Peter Pickl} for his ideas and help throughout writing this thesis. I especially want to thank him for his great support and the freedom I had.
