\chapter*{Acknowledgment}

I would like to thank my supervisor \href{http://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/personen/professoren/pickl/index.html}{Prof. Dr. Peter Pickl} for his help and support. I especially want to thank him for allowing me to choose the thesis's topic freely and for continuing to allow me great freedom throughout the entire process of writing the thesis.

I also want to thank my second supervisor \href{http://homepages.physik.uni-muenchen.de/~vondelft/}{Prof. Dr. Jan von Delft} for correcting this thesis and for conducting my oral exam.
